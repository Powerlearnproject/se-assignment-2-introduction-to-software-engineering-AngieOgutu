# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
Software Engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools to the development and maintenance of high quality software systems.

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software Engineering is a disciplined and process driven approach(Using the Software Development Lifecycle) to developing high quality, scalable and maintanable software systems while traditional programming is the process of writing code without following a structured methodology to develop software systems..

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
The Software Development Lifecycle is a structured process followed by Software Engineers that outlines the various stages involved in the development of software applications; providing a framework for designing, executing and managing software projects effectively.

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Requirements: This is where User Needs and System Requirements are gathered and documented

Design: Here, a detailed architecture or blueprint is created. This includes UI, system architecture, data structures and algorithms.

Implementation: Actual code is written at this point using the desired programming languages and frameworks

Testing: Various tests are performed to ensure the software meets the quality standards and functional requirements

Deployment: The software is released to the intended users

Maintenance: This is the ongoing support given to the software to ensure it continues to function correctly. It involves bug fixes, continuous updates, implementing new features, etc.

Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Waterfall model is a sequential approach with distinct phases, where each phase has to be completed before moving on to the next. Agile model is an iterative and incremental approach that is flexible, collaborative and responsive to change. 

An agile model can be used in longer term projects and those with rapidly changing or unclear requirements while a waterfall model can be used in shorter term projects and those with well-defined, stable requirements

Requirements Engineering:
What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
It is a process that involves the identification, documentation, analysis and management of the requirements of a software system. It typically involves the following steps: Requirements Elicitation, Requirements Analysis and Negotiation, Requirements Documentation, Requirements Validation and Requirements Management. It ensures the final product meets the needs and expectations of its users and stakeholders and helps mitigate risk

Software Design Principles:
Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Modularity is a software engineering design principle that involves dividing software systems into separate, independent and interchangeable components or modules. Each module is responsible for a specific functionality or a set of related functionalities and interacts with other modules through well defined interfaces.
It improves maintanability by isolation of changes, simplifying debugging and testing and through the reusability of modules.
It improves scalability through the ability for incremental development,  parallel development and load distribution.

Testing in Software Engineering:
Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.

Software Project Management:
Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
Submission Guidelines:
Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
Provide real-world examples or case studies wherever possible.
Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
Submit your completed assignment by [due date].
