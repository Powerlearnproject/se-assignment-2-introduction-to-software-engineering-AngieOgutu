Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
Software Engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools to the development and maintenance of high quality software systems.

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software Engineering is a disciplined and process driven approach(Using the Software Development Lifecycle) to developing high quality, scalable and maintanable software systems while traditional programming is the process of writing code without following a structured methodology to develop software systems..

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
The Software Development Lifecycle is a structured process followed by Software Engineers that outlines the various stages involved in the development of software applications; providing a framework for designing, executing and managing software projects effectively.

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Requirements: This is where User Needs and System Requirements are gathered and documented

Design: Here, a detailed architecture or blueprint is created. This includes UI, system architecture, data structures and algorithms.

Implementation: Actual code is written at this point using the desired programming languages and frameworks

Testing: Various tests are performed to ensure the software meets the quality standards and functional requirements

Deployment: The software is released to the intended users

Maintenance: This is the ongoing support given to the software to ensure it continues to function correctly. It involves bug fixes, continuous updates, implementing new features, etc.

Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Waterfall model is a sequential approach with distinct phases, where each phase has to be completed before moving on to the next. Agile model is an iterative and incremental approach that is flexible, collaborative and responsive to change. 

An agile model can be used in longer term projects and those with rapidly changing or unclear requirements while a waterfall model can be used in shorter term projects and those with well-defined, stable requirements

Requirements Engineering:
What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
It is a process that involves the identification, documentation, analysis and management of the requirements of a software system. It typically involves the following steps: Requirements Elicitation, Requirements Analysis and Negotiation, Requirements Documentation, Requirements Validation and Requirements Management. It ensures the final product meets the needs and expectations of its users and stakeholders and helps mitigate risk

Software Design Principles:
Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Modularity is a software engineering design principle that involves dividing software systems into separate, independent and interchangeable components or modules. Each module is responsible for a specific functionality or a set of related functionalities and interacts with other modules through well defined interfaces.
It improves maintanability by isolation of changes, simplifying debugging and testing and through the reusability of modules.
It improves scalability through the ability for incremental development,  parallel development and load distribution.

Testing in Software Engineering:
Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Unit Testing - Involves testing individual components or units of code, typically functions or methods, in isolation from the rest of the system. It is used to verify that each unit of the software performs as expected.

Integration Testing - Involves testing the interaction between integrated units/modules to identify interface defects and ensure they work together as expected. It is used to verify that combined units function correctly when integrated.

System Testing - Involves testing the complete and integrated software system to verify that it meets specified requirements. It is used to ensure that the entire system functions correctly and meets the defined requirements.

Acceptance Testing - Involves testing the system with the intent of validating that it meets business requirements and is ready for deployment. It is used to ensure that the software meets the needs of the end-users and stakeholders.

Software testing is a critical aspect of the software development lifecycle that ensures the quality, functionality, and reliability of the software product. It is essential for identifying and fixing defects early, validating requirements, improving performance, enhancing security, and ensuring overall user satisfaction.

Version Control Systems:
What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Version Control Ststems are tools that help manage changes to source codes and other collections of information. They keep track of every modification to the code in a special kind of database. If a mistake is made, developers can turn back the clock and compare earlier versions of the code to help fix the mistake while minimizing disruption to all team members.
Version control systems are important for collaboration, tracking and reverting changes, branching and merging, backup and restoration, and code review and quality control.
Some popular version control systems include:
Git
Features:
Distributed VCS: Every developer has a complete copy of the repository.
Branching and Merging: Lightweight branches allow for easy context switching and experimental development.
Performance: Fast operations, especially for local actions.
GitHub/GitLab Integration: Popular platforms for hosting Git repositories, providing additional features like issue tracking, CI/CD, and code review tools.

Subversion
Features:
Centralized VCS: A single repository for the entire team.
Atomic Commits: Ensures that a commit is a single unit of change.
Versioned Directories: Tracks changes to directories, not just files.
Access Control: Granular permissions can be set for different parts of the repository.

Mercurial
Features:
Distributed VCS: Similar to Git, every developer has a full copy of the repository.
Simplicity: Easier to learn and use compared to Git, with a strong emphasis on simplicity.
Performance: Designed to handle large codebases efficiently.
Integrated Web Interface: Comes with a built-in web interface for browsing the repository.

Software Project Management:
Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
A software project manager is responsible for overseeing and managing the planning, execution, and successful completion of software development projects. They ensure that projects are delivered on time, within scope, and within budget, while also meeting quality standards.

Key Responsibilities:
Project Planning
Resource Management
Budget Management
